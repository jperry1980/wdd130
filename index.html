        <p>California is a state in the Western United States. It has been meticulously and systematically destroyed by liberals and their wonderful ideas. The state is bordered by Oregon to the east and Nevada and Arizona to the West. Mexico is to the south. People from California are fleeing the state and taking their wonderful ideas that ruined this state to states across the nation and progressively destroying them as well. What a beautiful legacy!</p>
